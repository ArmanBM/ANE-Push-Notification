# Use
You can use this method to register for push notification token:
- PushNotification.getInstance().registerForPushNotification(GOOGLE_PLAY_ACCOUNT);
You don't need a Google play account for iOS Devices.
Once the user has given his permission:
an event PushNotificationEvent.PERMISSION_GIVEN_WITH_TOKEN_EVENT is sent.


# Installation
The ANE is already compiled. You can find it under the folder Binaries. 
If you want to recompile it, just run ant in the same directory, after changing the parameters (called properties) in build.xml.

# IOS Compilation
